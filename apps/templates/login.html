    <center><h1>PROGRAMMING  LANGUAGES</h1></center>
    <p>A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of strings that produce various kinds of 
        machine code output. Programming languages are one kind of computer language, and are used in computer 
        programming to implement algorithms. </p>

    <a href="registration.html"> 1.Python </a>
    <p>Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes
         code readability with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its 
         object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale 
         projects</p>

    <p>The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be

    <a href="registration.html">3.JavaScript</a>
    <p>JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.
    It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, 
    supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming 
    interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the 
    Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
